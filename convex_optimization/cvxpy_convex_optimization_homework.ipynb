This definition is based upon the book written: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/, where in chapter 5, you can also find this definition. Basically this means that the equality constraints are solved against the negative of the gradient of f, whereas in your book it's the other way around. Hopefully, by this time you read this, it is clear. :)"

    "$c_1$ constrains the region of interest to a half plane, while $a_1$ constrains it a straight line with a slope of 1 and going through $(0, 2)$. Knowing that the global minimizer of the function is $(0, 0)$, then the solution to the problem must be the closest point to the origin that belongs to both the line defined by $a_1$ and the half plane defined by $c_1$. The closest point from the line to the origin would be the point of intersection between a line perpendicular to the line defined by $a_1$ that crosses the origin. In this case, that point is $(-1, 1)$, which also fulfils the inequality constrain and therefore must be the minimizer of $f$ in the region. CVXPY yields the following solutions:"
