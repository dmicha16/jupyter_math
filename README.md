# Math related Jupyter Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dmicha16/jupyter_math/master)

A collection of math related jupyter notebooks I make to create a better and more intuitive understanding of certain math topics

Currently, there is only one jupyter notebook in the repo. It's a recreation of some convex optimzation based homework I've had on an earlier semester. I'm planning on adding more notebooks and I progress through my masters education.
