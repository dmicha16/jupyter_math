# jupyter_math
A collection of math related jupyter notebooks I make to create a better and more intuitive understanding of certain math topics

Currently, there is only one jupyter notebook in the repo. It's a recreation of some convex optimzation based homework I've had on an earlier semester. I'm planning on adding more notebooks and I progress through my masters education.
